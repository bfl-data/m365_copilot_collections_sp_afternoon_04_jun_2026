---

### Step 1 — Fill in the Template

```
Act as a Microsoft Copilot prompt expert.

I am a Collections Officer at Bajaj Finance Limited.
I need to summarise customer call interactions and extract structured
documentation — including call outcome, promise-to-pay details, and

The prompt should specify: role, task, context, output format, and tone.
```

### Step 2 — Copilot Generates Your Working Prompt

Task: Review the call log provided and generate a structured CRM entry
for each interaction.

Context: These are outbound collections calls made to overdue customers
across Personal Loan, Home Loan, Gold Loan, Two-Wheeler, and Business
Loan portfolios. Calls may result in PTP confirmation, escalation,
dispute, or no response.

Output format — use these labeled fields for each entry:
- Customer Name & Account ID
- Product & DPD
- Outstanding Amount (₹)
- Call Outcome (PTP Confirmed / Escalated / No Response / Dispute / Partial PTP)
- PTP Date & PTP Amount (if applicable)
- Key Points from the Call (2–3 bullets)
- Actions Taken
- Next Follow-up Date & Method

Tone: Factual, professional, CRM-ready. No filler text.
```

   and recommended next step for each.

(61–90 DPD), Medium (31–60 DPD), and Low (1–30 DPD). Risk score is
calculated as DPD × Outstanding. Field visits are pre-assigned for
selected accounts.

Output format:
- Top 5 Critical accounts ranked by risk score with recommended action
- Top 5 High priority accounts where last contact was 7+ days ago
- Summary table: total outstanding exposure by priority tier
- Field visit list: accounts marked "Yes" with suggested visit sequence

Tone: Direct, action-oriented, suitable for a morning team briefing.
```

2. From High priority accounts, flag those where last contact was
   before 25 May 2026 — these need urgent outreach today.
3. Create a summary table showing total account count and outstanding
   exposure (₹ Cr) for each priority tier.
4. List all accounts where Field Visit = Yes and suggest a sequenced
   visit plan for the field team.

month-on-month comparison table for Mar/Apr/May, three key
observations, and two June 2026 action recommendations.

Flag: Collection efficiency improved from 68.2% in Oct to 78.4% in
May — confirm this trend and highlight whether the 80% target is
achievable in June based on the trajectory.

Also note: escalations spiked in May (94 vs 41 in April) —
call this out as a risk item requiring management attention.
```

data by product, last 3 months) and Recovery Strategy Tracker (segment-
wise strategy, channel, target vs actual recovery %). Roll-forward rate
measures accounts migrating from a lower to a higher DPD bucket.

Output format:
1. Roll-forward analysis — worst product and trend vs prior month
2. Segments where actual recovery is 5%+ below target — with corrective action
3. Best-practice insight — what is Gold Loan doing right and can it apply elsewhere?
4. Portfolio health summary (150 words) for use as a meeting opening statement

Tone: Analytical, strategic, actionable. Suitable for a leadership review.
```

```
I am attaching our Overdue Trend Analysis and Recovery Strategy
Tracker for May 2026.

1. Which product has the worst roll-forward rate in May? Is it better
   or worse than April? What is the likely cause?
2. Identify segments in the Recovery Strategy Tracker where actual
   recovery is furthest below target. Suggest one specific corrective
   action for each in June 2026.
3. Gold Loan shows 88% recovery — the best in the portfolio. Based on
   the data, what factors explain this? Can any be applied to Business
   Loans where recovery is only 68.9%?
4. Write a 150-word portfolio health summary I can read at the start
   of our monthly strategy review meeting.
```
